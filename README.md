# Mystery Sum Challenge -- A Gem Game
This is the fourth assignment for the University of Richmond Coding Bootcamp.

In this assignment, we had to create a fun and interactive game for web browsers which used the jQuery library to update the HTML page.

## Getting Started
You will be given a random number at the start of the game. There are four gems on the page. By clicking on a gem you will add a specific amount of points to your total score. You win the game by matching your total score to the random number. You lose the game if your total score goes above the random number. The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.
